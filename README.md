# RBIV (Real-Estate)

RBIV (Real-Estate) is a MERN (MongoDB,Express.js,React.js,Node.js) project that was developed by Robert, Braxton, Immanuel, and Vukasin. We created an application that lets a user(in our case a realtor) create a listing where they can add a property to our website. 
Our Website is Mobile Friendly.
- The user is able to add:
    - number of bedrooms
    - number of bathrooms
    - price of the house
    - size of the house
    - address of the house
    - type of house they can choose from:
        - house
        - apartment
        - town house
        - office
    - description of the house
- This project is our MVP. 
    - We still have some features coming down the pipeline.
